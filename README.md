This Python program implements a simple guessing game, Hangman, where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word letter by letter. 
Each correctly guessed letter is then filled in wherever it appears in the word.
The game provides a limited number of tries, and the player loses if they exhaust all attempts without guessing the word correctly.

Features:

Random Word Selection:
A word is randomly chosen from a list of computer science-related terms, and the player has to guess the word letter by letter.

Guessing Mechanism:
The word is displayed as dashes (-), representing the number of letters in the word.
The player guesses letters individually. If the letter is correct, it fills the respective position in the word. Otherwise, the number of attempts decreases.

Tries and Feedback:
The player has 6 attempts to guess the word. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of tries left.
The game displays previously guessed letters and the current state of the guessed word.

Victory or Loss:
The game ends when the player either guesses the entire word correctly or runs out of attempts.

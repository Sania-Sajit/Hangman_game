This Python program implements a simple guessing game, Hangman, where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word letter by letter. 
Each correctly guessed letter is then filled in wherever it appears in the word.
The game provides a limited number of tries, and the player loses if they exhaust all attempts without guessing the word correctly.
